# Hooper 

## What is Hooper?

Hooper is a command line tool that enables dbt developers to automatically update package dependencies and required dbt versions in dbt packages. At Fivetran, it is used every time a dbt or dbt-utils release occurs.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

In order to use Hooper, you will need to clone this repository. You can do so using the method of your choosing.

### 2. Set up a local environment

We recommend creating a separate Python virtual environment for Hooper.

NOTE: If you already have a preferred approach for creating a Python virtual environment, you can skip this step!

Create a Python virtual environment for Hooper. If you don't already have a preferred way of doing this, we recommend pyenv-virtualenv. Follow the instructions to install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv. Then, from the Hooper repository, run the following:
```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8 hooper && pyenv local hooper
```

### 3. Install the necessary libraries

Once you've created and activated your virtual environment, run the following to install the necessary dependencies:
```base
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set the configurations

In order to update dbt packages, the `package_manager.yml` file needs to be updated with:

* All the repos to be updated. This is under the `repositories` key. 
* The bounds for the `require-dbt-verion` variable in the `dbt_project.yml` files of each package to be updated. 
* The version of dbt to be used in CircleCI to test the upgrades. This is under the `ci-dbt-version` key. 
* The version of each dependent package should be updated to in all the dbt packages, i.e. dbt-utils, fivetran-utils. 

### 5. Run Hooper

You've now got everything setup and can run Hooper. To do so, you can run the following command:
```bash
python main.py --repo-type source
```
That command will update all the 'source' repositories with the following changes:
* Bump any packages in `packages.yml` to the version(s) set in `package_manager.yml`
* Bump the `require-dbt-version` in `dbt_project.yml` to the version(s) set in `package_manager.yml`
* Bump the installed version of dbt in `integration_tests/requirements.txt` to the version set in `package_manager.yml`

Once that is complete, Hooper will open a pull request on each repository and print the URL for the pull request to the terminal. 

# Using the Package Updater for mass repo updates

## Prerequisites 
- Create a `credentials.yml` file that resembles `samples.credentials.yml`.  
    - You will first need to [create an ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) locally and then add it to your `github/settings/ssh and gpg keys`. Remember to configure SSO and authorize Fivetran. 
    - You will need to create a token in Github. Navigate to `github/settings/developer settings/personal access tokens/tokens classic` and create a new token. Name it clearly. Select the settings you need for this token. Set an expiration. Copy and paste the token into your `credentials.yml` file.

- Update the `package_manager.yml` for all packages you wish to perform the updates on. To be on the safe side of API limits, you may need to only run the script on a subset of data at a time. In other words, you will need to comment out packages and run the updater on about 10 a time.

- If you are creating branches for the first time -- you will need to make sure in `main.py` you set `branch_exists = False`. If you are updating branches that already have changes, you will need to set `branch_exists = True`. 

## Customization
### Setting up Branch Names and Commit Messages
You can update the values in `set_defaults()` to your desired branch name and commit message. 

### Creating a PR checklist
You can navigate to `open_pull_request()` and update "body" with your checklist. The list needs to be a one-liner or else the formatting gets thrown off.

## Features
### Removing Files
To remove files, navigate to the main function and find the variable `        files_to_remove`. You can update this list with the files' file paths you would like to remove. The path starts from the root directory of the dbt project you are updating. For example, to remove your `integration_tests/requirements.txt` you would declare the `files_to_remove` variable like so:

```python
files_to_remove = ['integration_tests/requirements.txt']
```

### Adding Files
To add files, navigate to the main function and find the variable `files_to_add`. You can update this list with the files' file paths you would like to add. The path starts from the root directory of the dbt project you are updating. You will need to add the files into the `dbt_package_updater/docs` folder under the same structure as the dbt project you are updating. For example, if you want to add a new `requirements2.txt` file into your integration test directory on your dbt project you would:

1. Create an `integration_tests` directory within the `docs` directory of this repo. 
2. Add the file `requirements2.txt` into `integration_tests`
3. Delcare your `files_to_add` variable like so:
```python
files_to_add = ['integration_tests/requirements2.txt']
```

### Finding and Replacing Values (Minor WIP)
Currently, this function has quite a bit of hard coded logic that will need to be made more flexible. The current function is from the latest migration mass update (dbt utils v1.0 migration + buildkite). 

To find and replace certain values, for example, you will need to:

1. Update your `find-and-replace-list` values inside your `package_manager.yml` file to include all the values you wish to replace. 
2. Update the `find_and_replace()` function in your `main.py` to execute the logic you would like to implement. 

### ðŸš§ Updating packages.yml (Big WIP) ðŸš§
Currently, this function does not perform as easily as desired. Will need to be updated. The intention is to update all `packages.yml` files such that a new version bump is incorporated for relevant packages. 

### ðŸš§ Updating dbt_project.yml (Big WIP) ðŸš§
Currently, this function does not perform as consistently as desired. Will need to be updated. The intention is to update all `dbt_project.yml` (root project and integration_tests) for a minor/major version bump. In the last roll out, we discovered that this wasn't working for roughly half our packages.
